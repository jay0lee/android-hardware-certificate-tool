# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2, 2026

**Hardware Certificate Tool** ("the App") is an open-source Android application developed by Jay Lee. This privacy policy describes how the App handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The App operates entirely locally on your device.
* **Private Keys:** Keys generated by the App are stored in your device's secure hardware (TEE or StrongBox). They are never transmitted to the developer or any third-party server.
* **CSRs (Certificate Signing Requests):** When you generate a CSR, the data is processed locally and copied to your system clipboard so you can manually send it to your administrator. The App does not transmit this data.
* **Certificates:** Certificates installed via the App are stored in the Android System KeyChain.

## 2. Permissions
The App requests the following permissions to function:
* **INTERNET:** Required by the Android OS for network operations, though this App primarily functions offline for manual key provisioning.
* **KeyChain Access:** The App requests permission to install certificates into the system KeyChain. This interaction is handled by the Android OS system dialogs.

## 3. Third-Party Services
The App uses the following open-source libraries for cryptographic operations:
* **Bouncy Castle:** Used for local ASN.1 encoding and CSR generation. It does not collect user data.

## 4. Security
This App is designed to leverage Android's hardware-backed security (Trusted Execution Environment and StrongBox) to protect your cryptographic keys. The source code is open-source and available for audit on [GitHub](https://github.com/jay0lee/android-hardware-certificate-tool).

## 5. Contact
If you have questions about this privacy policy, you may open an issue on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jay0lee/android-hardware-certificate-tool).
